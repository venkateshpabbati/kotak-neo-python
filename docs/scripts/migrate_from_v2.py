"""Migration helper: scan a project using neo-api-client (kotak-neo-api-v2)
and report the changes needed to move to kotakneoapi (kotak-neo-python).

Usage:
    python docs/scripts/migrate_from_v2.py /path/to/user/project
    python docs/scripts/migrate_from_v2.py file1.py file2.py

This tool never edits files. It only reports what needs manual attention,
because several v2 features (bracket/cover orders, per-order risk params,
callback-based WebSockets) have no direct equivalent in the new SDK and
require a human decision, not a mechanical rename.
