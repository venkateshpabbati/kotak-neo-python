"""Modern async/await WebSocket client for the SFeed market-data feed.

Implements the ``native_batch`` protocol:

* Control plane — JSON text frames (auth, subscribe, unsubscribe, snapshot).
* Data plane — binary frames (little-endian, packed, batched); decoded by
  :mod:`neo_api_client.websocket.feed.protocol`.

There is no application-level heartbeat in this mode; the WebSocket layer's
native ping/pong keeps the connection alive.

        """Initialize the client.

        Args:
            access_token: Session token (retained for compatibility; the feed
                uses the ``user``/``auth`` credentials below, not this token).
            sid: Session id. Also used as the default ``auth`` credential (see
                ``auth`` below) — some endpoints (e.g. the beta feed) reject
                the connection a few seconds in if ``auth`` doesn't match a
                real session's sid.
            url: Feed URL (default: SFeed production ``/wsfeed``).
            ucc: Unique Client Code (from the totp_login()/totp_validate()
                response). Used as the default ``user`` credential (see
                ``user`` below).
            user: ``user`` credential for the native_batch auth frame.
                Defaults to ``ucc`` when not given; falls back to the demo
                placeholder ``"neome"`` only if ``ucc`` is also not given
                (e.g. constructing without a real session, such as in tests).
            auth: ``auth`` credential for the native_batch auth frame.
                Defaults to ``sid`` when not given; falls back to ``"1"`` only
                if ``sid`` is also not given (e.g. constructing without a real
                session, such as in tests).
            source: Client identification (default 'NEOTRADEAPI').
            platform: Client platform string (default 'Web').
            version: Client version string sent in the auth frame.
            sdk_version: SDK/build version integer sent in the auth frame.
            sdk_date: SDK/build date string sent in the auth frame.
            session_validation: Value for the ``sessionValidation`` auth field.
            reconnect_delay: Seconds between reconnect attempts (also used
                between initial connect retries, see ``max_connect_retries``).
            max_reconnect_attempts: Maximum number of times to reconnect after
                a previously established connection later drops.
            max_connect_retries: Maximum number of retries for the *initial*
                ``connect()`` call itself if opening the socket fails (e.g. a
                transient network error) — separate from
                ``max_reconnect_attempts``, which only applies after a
                connection has already succeeded once. Default 3. Set to 0
                to fail immediately on the first attempt, with no retries.
            ping_interval: WebSocket-level ping interval (keep-alive) in seconds.
            max_subscriptions: Maximum total input tokens that may be subscribed
                at once across all subscribe requests (LTP, option chain, etc.).
                Default 3000. A request that would exceed this raises
                :class:`SubscriptionError`.
            verify_ssl: Verify the server's TLS certificate on ``wss://``
                connections (default True). Only set to False for a trusted
                development endpoint with a self-signed certificate; disabling
                verification exposes the connection to man-in-the-middle attacks.
            ack_wait_timeout: Seconds to wait for the server's subscribe
                acknowledgement (message_code 1109, carrying the
                trading_symbols map) after sending a subscribe frame.
                Default 5.0. While an ack is outstanding, messages for
                instruments whose ``trading_symbol`` is still unknown are
                decoded but their **delivery is withheld**; instruments
                already resolved (from an earlier subscribe) keep streaming
                immediately, unaffected. Withheld messages are kept one per
                ``(instrument, message type/level)`` key — each new message
                for the same key overwrites the previous one, so only the
                latest survives; market-open/close events are never
                withheld, since a later "closed" would otherwise erase an
                earlier "open" instead of both being delivered. In-between
                ticks during the wait are discarded on purpose — the latest
                tick per key is preserved, not every tick — matching a live
                feed where an out-of-date price is superseded the moment a
                newer one arrives; this is not a delta feed, and callers
                that need every individual tick (e.g. for tick-by-tick
                volume/trade-count analytics) should not rely on this
                window. As soon as the ack lands, every held-back key's
                latest message is delivered — enriched with its now-known
                ``trading_symbol`` — and normal per-message delivery resumes
                for that instrument. If no ack arrives within the timeout,
                the same release happens anyway (with ``trading_symbol=None``
                for keys the map has no entry for) so the feed never stalls
                indefinitely on a missing ack — this applies per subscribe
                call, so two overlapping subscribes each get their own
                timeout rather than one release affecting the other's
                unresolved instruments. ``subscribe_scrips()`` (etc.) also
                waits up to this long before returning.
